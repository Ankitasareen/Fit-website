# Fitnessify 

## Inspiration
Because of the pandemic, people realize the importance of caring for their health more and more. There is now an ongoing demand for ways to train more effectively and conveniently since people cannot go out and need to do social distancing. Further, even after pandemic, the thought of training conveniently anytime or anywhere is now imprinted in many customers’ minds. 

These facts all point to the need for creating an AI powered personal fitness trainer site that can assist customers anytime or anywhere they want. The AI fitness trainer can  understand the customers’ needs  and is able to develop a well planned training plan. The AI fitness trainer checks and improves customers’ fitness routines while making remote support accessible. 

Because of the above requirements, we designed our site, Fitnessify, for customers to check and improve their fitness routine. The solutions our team came up with were to build an AI powdered personal fitness trainer site with an AI chat bot that advises customers about training tips and metrics about training progress of the customers. 

## What it does
An AI powdered personal fitness trainer site with an AI chat bot that advises customers about training tips. Customers can see personalized fitness routine, diet plans and their weekly progress stats (metrics about training progress of the customers) on their logged in dashboards. Customers also have an AI Fitness assistant which assists them in their workouts. There is a posture analyzer and a Yoga posture detector built on AI just to assist the customers. We also have automatic communication with customers through Twilio. Customer can send text message and will get automatic text message/phone call for more assistant.
